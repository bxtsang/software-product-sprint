        <h1>More about me...</h1>
        <h3>Water Polo</h3>
        <p>
          I am a huge water polo lover. I've played the sport competitively since I was 14 in
          my various school teams, and was part of the <b>Singapore National Men's Water Polo team</b> from 2016 to 2018.
          I've also been a coach for many youth and school teams, coaching players between 9 to 17 years old.
        </p>
        <p>
          Water polo has moulded my character, teaching me the very basics of discipline and hardwork,
          while also training me to work well in teams using good communication and leadership skills.
          Hence, even as I pursue a profession now away from this sport, the mindset I've inherited from water polo still very much defines me.

        <h3><br/>Tech!</h3>
        <p>
          I started my tech journey in 2018 after enrolling in the <b>SMU School of Information Systems</b>.
          From basic programming, I quickly picked up an interest for software development.
          I particularly enjoy the entire process of building solutions for real problems, from ideation all the way to the implementation and solution management.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my projects, I always believe the end product is only as valuable as how well it addresses the problem it intends to solve.
          Therefore, as much as the technical specifications, I tend to focus on fitting the solution with the <b>business process</b>,
          <b>user requirements</b>, and the overall <b>value proposition</b> of any product.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of my projects are listed in the next section!
        </p>
        <h3><br/>Start-up</h3>
        <p>
          In 2018, I started a company called HaBaWaBa Asia Pte Ltd. With my team, we secured the Asian rights for HaBaWaBa,
          the biggest international kids water polo festival. We then organized the festival here in Singapore (the first time in Asia),
          where there we had about 200 participants from 6 different countries over a span of 4 days.
        </p>
        <p>
          My role was to pitch the festival and secure event partners and grants, manage corporate relations, as well as direct my team's execution of the festival.
